# NexoBT
*Nexo* - in Latin connection - *BT* - Bluetooth. is a bluetooth receiver born from the need to connect a bluetooth audio receiver to a professional audio system with DMX outputs; something that is not very common on the market and so I decided to create it myself.

# For now I have decided that it will have some features necessarily present:

.1 it will have an external 2.4 GHz antenna.
.2 it will be based on an esp chip
.3 it will have mono DMX outputs or in any case balanced

I will also try to design a 3d case.
